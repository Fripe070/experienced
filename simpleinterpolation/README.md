# simpleinterpolation

This is a simple library I created because I wanted something to take strings from users
and interpolate them with variables.

It was created for [speederboard](https://github.com/randomairborne/speederboard) and
is mainly used in [experienced](https://github.com/randomairborne/experienced) and [tunnelbana](https://github.com/randomairborne/tunnelbana).
