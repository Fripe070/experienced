# Leaderboards are now phased out

In the interest of decreased user data storage we are disabling public, web leaderboards. Leaderboards will still be
available over discord with the `/leaderboard` command, where they will use Discord's Interactions technology to give
you a rich leaderboard experience, on all devices, without leaving the app.

If you have questions, please email me at `valk (at) randomairborne (dot) dev`.
